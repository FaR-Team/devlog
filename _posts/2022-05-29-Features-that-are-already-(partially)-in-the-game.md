I'm sure that none of what I'm about to show you will make you drop your jaw, but I feel the need to have an archive of every single progress made during the development of this game.

*   **Crop growing system:**

There is only one vegetable officially added to the game, the carrot. Say hi to the carrot.

Carrot.  

    Orange

  

    Healthy

  

    And voxel.

  

  

  

  

  

  

  

Since the carrot is the only vegetable, it is being used as a test subject for every single feature related to tubers. That being said, there are no seeds in-game (yet), so, with the press of a button, you can plant your own baby carrot.

Baby carrots.

  
Once your baby carrots are in fresh soil, ready to grow, you may go to bed (yup, you cannot water them just yet). A couple days later; they'll be bigger.

Bigger baby carrots.

  
Alright, yeah, ignore that it is exactly the next day and they're full grown adults now, we, as the developers, can play God for a while to demonstrate a feature. In the actual game, it will take more days for the vegetables to grow and they will go through more stages (In fact, carrots have another stage already programmed, but we decided not to show it to go straight to the point).

And you can harvest them!

And you can harvest them!

*   **Inventory system**

The only item available is, you guessed it, carrots. Both the hotbar and the inventory are fully functional, they are full of placeholders so they are ugly as a yellow carrot, so we won't show much about it. ALSO we have functional chests.

And they pop into docens of carrots!

*   **Day/Night cycle**

The title says it all. However, I don't like how it looks right now, and our lead programmer is already investigating on different systems that will look more fitting to our vision. meanwhile, enjoy a cube.

Maybe the only thing here that is fully implemented.

  

And that's basically it! As I said, nothing jaw dropper here for now, but it is a beginning. As you can see in the pictures, there is also a season's system and an energy bar, but since there is not much to say about it, I decided not to mention them.

  

The game is growing and that makes me really happy!
