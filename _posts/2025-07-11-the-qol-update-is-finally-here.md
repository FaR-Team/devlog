After the release of Room Makers, we received tons of feedback that could improve the game into something more entertaining, user friendly and less janky. We are more than thankful for all that feedback, because not only it is invaluable to have so many points of view over our project, but also because it humbled us and allowed us to learn a lot of things.

We don't have much to say that haven't already been said in the previous posts, so let's jump to all the changes:
* **Added a preview of the kit placement during the tutorial with a cutesy animation.**
* Added an entire main menu!
* Added localization to the main menu.
* Added localization to the labeler.
* Added a Tag Notification that shows the current room’s tag when entering a new room
* Added a credit screen to the menu
* Added a confirmation screen for tutorial skipping.
* **Added a furniture info menu when pressing the start button.**
* Added a sprite for the furniture info menu prompt.
* Added descriptions to all the furniture.
* Added google play’s leaderboard.
* Improved the placing system so now Wall Objects are placed as boxes if they’re not against a wall.
* Improved the game over screen.
* Fixed some tutorial animations.
* Fixed the Restock Machine’s cost text weird overlap depending on player’s position
* Fixed shake. Now it doesn’t offset the object anymore.
* Fixed door’s shake, same as above, plus made it shakier.
* Fixed an issue with the main menu... we actually just told one of our programmers not to use the enter button anymore.
* Fixed wall object’s indicator when boxed not showing up.
* Fixed a bug where the correct localization of the tutorial skip prompt didn’t show up.
* Updated our csv tool to reflect the new fields in the data.
* Made a devtool to quickly change the build parameters (WIP)
* Made a devtool to visualize the furniture relationships.
* Made a devtool to analyze the game’s balance.
* Made a devtool to manage the game’s localizations.

#### Added a preview of the kit placement during the tutorial with a cutesy animation.
An important piece of feedback we received was how unnecessarily complicated the tutorial was. When we took the 1.0.0 to the GameMakers event, a lot of the questions we've received were about the tutorial, more specifically, the part where it thought you how to place a kit.
Due to this HUGE design flaw, we decided to make two changes; **[last update](http://blog.farteam.digital/2025/06/05/june-5ft-room-makers-1-0-2-hot-fix.html)** we added the possibility to place the kit over furniture, skiping some unnecessary steps that may make the whole process tedious rather than fun. Now, we've also added this illustrative animation during the tutorial~

Now you can't miss your steps!
#### Added a furniture info menu when pressing the start button.
Another complaint we received was about readability... if that's a thing. Basically, thanks to the tiny font (That we also changed in the last update) and the art style, understanding what furniture the player was carrying was a bit of a challenge.
From now on, if you press START while holding an object in your inventory, you'll get a full preview of the object and a description (maybe not a helpful one) about it. Is there lore in these descriptions? Yes.

*that's quite literally an anecdote, that happened that way.*

And that would be it for Room Makers. It is finally in a state we are proud to announce it and promote it. It took a while, but we are finally here.
Does this mean Room Makers will never recevie another update? Not at all. In fact, we look forwards to yoour feedback and comments, so expect future patch in case they are necessary. 
But that's not the only thing, we're also planning in many updates to come for Room Makers, but those are low priority right now.
Then, what comes next? Using everything we've learn from this release, we are going to work in our other games. Right now we are working on propper road maps for both KTA and The Farmoxel Projects. Once all of that is settled, we'll resume our work and will bring more updates.
Can you expect more playable DEMOs? Maybe from KTA once we reach a playable state, but I won't be so sure about The Farmoxel Project.
What about Big-? Zip it.

Hope you enjoy Room Makers and we'll love to hear from you~
Bye! Have a great time!
