After the release of Room Makers, we received tons of feedback that could improve the game into something more entertaining, user friendly and less janky. We are more than thankful for all that feedback, because not only it is invaluable to have so many point of view over our project, but also because it humbled us and allowed us to learn a lot of things.

We don't have much to say that haven't already been said in the previous posts, so let's jump to all the changes:
* ** Added a preview of the kit placement during the tutorial with a cutesy animation.**
* Added an entire main menu!
* Added localization to the main menu.
* Added localization to the labeler.
* Added a Tag Notification that shows the current roomâs tag when entering a new room
* Added a credit screen to the menu
* Added a confirmation screen for tutorial skipping.
* **Added a furniture info menu when pressing the start button.**
* Added a sprite for the furniture info menu prompt.
* Added descriptions to all the furniture.
* Added google playâs leaderboard.
* Improved the placing system so now Wall Objects are placed as boxes if theyâre not against a wall.
* Improved the game over screen.
* Fixed some tutorial animations.
* Fixed the Restock Machineâs cost text weird overlap depending on playerâs position
* Fixed shake. Now it doesnât offset the object anymore.
* Fixed doorâs shake, same as above, plus made it shakier.
* Fixed an issue with the main menu... we actually just told one of our programmers not to use the enter button anymore.
* Fixed wall objectâs indicator when boxed not showing up.
* Fixed a bug where the correct localization of the tutorial skip prompt didnât show up.
* Updated our csv tool to reflect the new fields in the data.
* Made a devtool to quickly change the build parameters (WIP)
* Made a devtool to visualize the furniture relationships.
* Made a devtool to analyze the gameâs balance.
* Made a devtool to manage the gameâs localizations.
