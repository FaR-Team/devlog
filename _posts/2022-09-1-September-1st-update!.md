Our ideal was to create more blogposts during August to talk about trivia on the game's development. Sadly, it was a tough month for most of the team, so most of the improvements down below, if not all, were made by the lead programmer.

Anyway! Cue the bullet-point-list!

  
- _Now we have our own toon shader! -Now we have our own water shader!_
- _Added the ability to interact with the hotbar using the mouse wheel and numbers from 1 to 0._
- _Replaced the placeholder for the clock. This is just a concept and will be changed once again in the future._
- _Added highlights for the hotbar. -Added a dropdown list to select a language. (Full Localization still indev)._
- _Added the option to change between a 24h and 12h clock._
- _Added the option to change the FOV._
- _Added the most awaited feature: Closing the inventory with Escape!!!!!! (or E, you choose)._
- _Added a little panel on the pause menu for testers to see the controls. -SEEDS ARE NOW (mostly) FUNCTIONAL._
- _The pause and option menus now change their language._
- _Improved day-night cycle._
- _Fixed bug that allowed you to plant crops on walls, roofs or characters' heads (Plant overlapping yet to be fixed)._
- _Fixed bug that let you move dirt's internal gameObject._
- _Fixed bug that allowed you to pick up items under you and fly away with them. (FINALLY)._
- _Fixed bug that allowed you to plant while in pause menu or inventory. (Thx qbo)._
- _Fixed bug that allowed you to move your Hotbar's highlighted space while holding an object._
- _Fixed bug that caused the backpack's inventory to not load properly if you opened a chest after opening your backpack._
- _Fixed bug that caused crops to be planted in the wrong grid position._
- _Fixed bug that made dirt update every time you planted something._
- _Fixed bug that caused carrots to softlock when harvesting them (Neither we know how it happened)._
- _Fixed Item Database._
- _Fixed bug that caused the energy bar to not show up when you harvested something. (plus, we added an easy way to make this with every crop in the future :D)._
- _Removed Herobrine._

**You know what comes next!**

#### 'Now we have our own water shader!'

How to add water to the game was widely discussed in the team since, having a voxel artstyle, it was a tough choice. Various ideas were discussed, such as adding voxel water with real-time physics, but we finally reached the conclusion to add a shader and call it a day. The result is simply beautiful, and, let me tell you, this is not the end of the improvements for the water in the game.

And that's basically all that we can show you right now. During this month, our lead programmer had to go through a couple of bugs in Unity that wouldn't allow him to access the project, making him waste a whole week.Â 

As for the new 3D models, they are almost done, hopefully next month they will be ready.

I'm truly sorry that this month is not as exciting as expected.

Bye, have a great time!
