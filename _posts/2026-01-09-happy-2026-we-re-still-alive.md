Last time we posted an update about our games was in **[This blog post](http://blog.farteam.com.ar/2025/07/11/the-qol-update-is-finally-here.html)**, and that was back in July 2025- Yikes.

One of my new year's resolution is to be more active in social media, starting with devlogs, even if that means making shorter entries with less content. I want to talk about a lot of things: the challenges caused by our, frankly, poorly organized development, the process behind some of our more complex features, and everything in between.

You might be wondering what did we do since the last time we posted here. Well, first of all, we migrated to a new domain. That alone took some time, plus a *lot of negotiation with our registrar* that ultimately led nowhere.
We also brought in a new programmer and a new 3D modeler, both of whom required* training and guidance* for well over two months.
Toward the end of 2025, some conditions and schedules with several members of the team had to be updated, which required a round of meetings and negociations which, fortunately, helped the team move forward without disagreements. 
On top of that, some of us live in the south hemisphere, which means it's summer, and heat waves combined with a lack of ACs or proper ventilation systems are brutal. You know [that episode of The Simpsons in which the sun tried to obliterate Milhouse?](https://tenor.com/es/view/milhouse-simpson-simpsons-gif-21176028) *My past few weeks were like that.* And yes, heat makes us WAY less productive.
Now, you may have noticed that some things are marked in italics? That's because I was the one who had to personally lead with all of those things. I'm the one training artists, coordinating with programmers who are training juniors, making decisions and handling negotiations related to the company's networking, and effectively filling an HR role for the team. 
Back in 2024, I had delegated some of these responsibilities to another team member, but he left the team quite a while ago.
So, what I'm trying to say is this: the stagnation in our game development over the past months is entirely my responsibility. It is my job to manage all of these situations and find the right path to take to help the team survive.
### This almost led to the cancellation of the Farmoxel project.

Oooh, that was a cold one, wasn't it?

Luckily, after some meeting and some help from coleagues, I put together a concrete list of steps to take to fix this issue. So we are ready to get back on track.

I won't make any big promises, that was a huge mistake from my side that not many people noticed. 

# Okay, great. Shut up. What is coming next?
Some psichiatrist will read these things understanding I am the one impersonating others to insult myself and will regret their tesis-

As of now, we are working on Room Makers 1.2.0, which will add some changes based on the players feedback, a new gamemode and a couple more things~

For the Farmoxel Project, we have three big announcements to make. We'll get to them once it is time, cause one of them is a feature we are very proud of... but it only works on the Unity Editor, but it is nowhere to be seen on a playable build. Right as I'm writing this, one of my programmers is playing Sherlock Holmes to fix it. He says 'hi :D'.

We are working on a proper road map, something we promised back in July but weren't able to put our head into that. Once it is done, it will be announce on it's own devlog.
And to finish it up, we have a list of over 30 changes done to thee Farmoxel Project. As a compensation for the lack of updates on our side, I'll post that one next week, even if it doesn't have much content to show or if it is not polished enough.

That's all I have to say today. I really hope that 2026 is a... brigther year for our team. 

Bye! Have a nice day~
