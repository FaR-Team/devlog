As soon as we decided to start working on the 1.1.0 QoL update someone reported a bug on the 1.0.1.  We thought "How bad could it be? After all, we fixed a big one". 
It was visual.
The bug was visual.
Think about it, a feature failing is a common bug by itself. But, as long as people don't follow the specific criteria to trigger it, some may miss it. That's the category where the 1.0.0 bug fall into.
A visual bug does not enjoy that advantage. No matter what you do, you'll always see it. And it'll be annoying.
That's why we had to stop the work on 1.1.0 to drop another hotfix-

That being said, here is the bullet-point-list of all the changes on this version:

* Added animations on the GUI when you earn of lose money
* Added a playerPref to know if the player has played the tutorial.
* Now the prompt for skipping the tutorial only appears on a second playthrough.
* Fixed a bug that caused the tutorial dialogues to skip if the player was standing on the doormat and an object arrived.
* Fixed a bug that replaced the dumbbells texture with... coconuts???
* **Fixed a bug where the 2x2 and 2x3 furniture displayed their sprites incorrectly.**
* Fixed a bug where the kit wouldnâ€™t update the sprite of the boxed up furniture in a combo if they were placed before the kit.
