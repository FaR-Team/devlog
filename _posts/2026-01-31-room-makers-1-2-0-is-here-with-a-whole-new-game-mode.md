Greetings! Told you it wouldn't take long before another update.
This update is the last one Room Makers will receive before the HUGE secret update we've been hinting for a while (Of course, if bug fixing is needed, we'll be there). So make sure to stick around until the end of the blog to find out the name of the next update

I know you may be anxious to know what's new, so let's jump to the pin-point-list of changes:

* **Added a new gamemode: Classic!**
	* Shops do not appear on classic mode.
	* Kits do not appear and are not necesary on classic mode.
	* Labels are not important for scoring.
	* Wall objects do not care about their placement.
	* Added a "Classic" mode option in the main menu.
	* Added localization to the "Classic" mode side of the menu.
* Added 8 new pallettes for the rooms
* **Added a full landscape orientation to the game!**
* **Added a landscape layout, with a cute sticker and everything.**
* Updated some of the color palettes to make them more appealing.
* Added a reset button (Pressing the on-off switch)
* Added bulk import and checking if they're equal to our palette manager unity-addon.
* Added an easter egg. (You can find it, I trust you.)
* Upgraded google play's plugins.
* Upgraded D-pad usability by enforcing strict 4-way input detection.
* Renamed choppingboard because it was too long.
* Now the "DMG" color palette it's only used in the main room.
* Now we're using a palette database instead of having a list of palettes on each scene, and each screen.
* Fixed a bug with the main menu's localization.
* Fixed a bug with the bookshelf's stacking.
* Fixed a bug where the first placement bonus would be given multiple times.
* Fixed a bug with the orientationmanager's position.
* Fixed a bug with the screen's position and scale on landscape.
* Fixed a bug where objects on the floor wouldn't give points when unboxed.

Now, I know there is not much to show visually, but this update has finally lays the foundation for our next big updates, so... progress has been made.

Let's talk about the highlighted ones;

### Added a new gamemode: Classic!
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/FaR-Team/devlog/main/images/room-makers-1-2-0-is-here-with-a-whole-new-game-mode-93ulhz.png)
This gamemode was entirelly built around players' feedback. While my original intention was to make the game more complex, assuming complexity would equal deeper, more engaging gameplay, the truth is that some more cassual players found it frustrating. Players who were lucky enough to try our very first DEMOs even mentioned that the game felt more fun back then.

Therefore, we added a **Classic** mode!

Kits? Gone. 
Tags? Gone. 
Shops? Gone. 

This is as simple as it gets! Place furniture, combine some, get points, buy rooms. 
Of course, the old Casual Mode it's still there, for those who want to experience the game as I intended. 

Maybe we should add a description for each game mode, since the title doesn't say much. But working with such limited UI is a challenge we, sometimes, cannot overcome. That said, this is VERY necessary for our next update.

When we first started the beta testing for Room Makers in actual phone devices, a lot of people instinctively rotated their phone to play on landscape. This was not part of our plans at the time, after all, the Gameboy Advance was a vertical rectangle, we had to remain faithfull to its desing.

But prioritizing aesthetics over player comfort is not a great idea. That's why we decided to desing a layout for landscape orientation and, honestly, it turned out to be REALLY comfortable to play. I strongly encourage you to test it as much as you can and leave your thoughts about it [here](https://farteam.com.ar/RoomMakersFeedback/)
We'll make any tweak necesary for it to be the best gaming experience.

And that's it. It may not be the biggest update ever, but it contains two of the most requested features for the game. We hope it encourages you to jump back into Room Makers and play a bit more.

That being said, we can talk about the next big update for Room Makers. 1.3.0 will be called... **THE ROGELITE UPDATE!!**
You may be really confused right now. Good for you.

Of course, that update is not at the top of our priorities, so don't expect that anytime soon. With that being said, I'll leave back to working on huge voxel art buildings.

Bye! Have a great time~
