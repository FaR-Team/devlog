During October and November, the team started working in 4 different projects, which divided us in Team A and team B. Does that mean we are crunching? Not at all! In fact, we haven't been working much these past months cause of university and such. Does this mean we take terrible decisions? Yes. Definitively.

There are no huge updates about the Farmoxel Project to showcase since the team is working in one of its biggest features: a proper save/load system. Therefore, we cannot show anything about that game.

I know this may sound disappointing, but working on the save/load system is the top priority for the game's development right now. Anything that needs to be done in the future requires that system to be fully functional.

With that said, allow me to introduce you to the other three projects:  

### Room Makers

Room Makers is a simple arcade tetris-like gameboy style game in which the player will have to place different items in a room, creating combos to earn points to buy new rooms to place their items.   
While not an overly complicated game, there are little hints of a lore sprinkled on it.

I know what you may be thinking, this game was already finished, is the one we made for the GB Jam 11. Thing is that a lot of stuff we planned for the original game didn't made the cut due to the time limit. In addition to that, the game was launched with some bugs and design flaws we would like to fix.

That's why we decided to do two things with it:

- First, we are gonna fix all the bugs rework some mechanics to make it as user friendly as possible 
- After that, we are gonna work on a mobile port of the game that will include lots more content, game modes, and more!

As of now, an early version of Room Makers can be played [**HERE**](https://justneki.com/RoomMakersWeb).

### KTA

KTA is a mobile game in which the player takes control of a tiny spaceship traveling through a procedurally generated space. Another simple game where the only goal is to make as many point as possible.  

This game already exist, in fact, it did for years! It was created by one our programmers. But we decided to revamp both the game's branding and the mechanics. Adding more obstacles for the player to avoid, new spaceship skins and more!

  

Work on this revamp has already begun, but the only thing we can share for now is this logo update:

This may not be the last change we will do to it tho.

### Big City Life

Do you know that indie obscure game about surviving in a blocky world? I think it is called Minecraft or something similar. A very niche game. Well, we decided to work on an entire gamemode for a Minecraft server.

The Gamemode is called Big City Life, a roleplay game that takes place in a... well... Big City. Get a job, buy a car, rent an apartment. There are a lot of things you can do in the city.

I know this one sounds WAY bigger than the other ones, but let me tell you, Team B is working on it, so its development will not hinder the main game's development at all.

Sadly, you cannot play this game just yet.

Have you noticed? All of these games have a unique name and the Farmoxel Project still doesn't... I have nothing to add to that, it's just sad.

ALSO! Before I forget, since some man child took over certain social media platform and decided to take the worst decisions he could ever think of, [**we created a Twitter account for the team!**](https://twitter.com/FaRTeamStudio) We won't be posting much tho, it is just there so we don't get charged to create it in the future... what a world we live in.

**Bye! Have a great time!**
