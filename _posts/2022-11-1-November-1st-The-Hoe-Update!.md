Welcome The Hoe Update:

~We know what you are thinking. No, this is not a joke about your mom.~

  

These last two months we were organizing the whole team to guaranty some aspects of the game's future. What does this mean for you? Nothing! But still, we have some good news!

  

First, the game is finally on BETA! Meaning that all of the core gameplay mechanics are (barely) functional. This does not mean that the game will be released anytime soon, at all. There are still a LOT of things to be done.

  

Second... I'll tell you about it after the bullet-point-list:

  

- _We added a Bowling minigame!_
- _Now you cast a (Placeholder) shadow!_
- _Now you can only plow land while holding a hoe, instead of doing it with your bare hands at any time._
- _Added a "Ghost" preview where you are going to plant/plow._
- _Replaced the old energy bar GUI._
- _Remade Shader. -Buying is now functional!_
- _Selling is now functional!_
- _Strawberries are now _fully_ functional! Which allows us to reuse the script for every single bush-type crop in the future._
- _Added an FPS cap. (Modifiable in settings)_
- _Added an FPS counter on-screen._
- _The FPS cap set saves automatically._
- _Added a version indicator on-screen._
- _Remade the planting and plowing systems._
- _Fixed bug that caused the crop explosions to be offcentered._
- _Fixed bug that caused jumps' imput to stack, making you jump multiple times._
- _Fixed strawberry's spawnpoints._
- _Fixed bug where you could harvest the same tuber multiple times._
- _Fixed bug where you could harvest the same bush multiple times._
- _Fixed bug where the energy bar wouldn't deplete nor show while harvesting bushes._
- _Fixed bug that caused the energy bar animation to play multiple times._
- _Fixed bug where you could plow over already plowed land, creating z-clipping as consequence._
- _Fixed bug that allowed the player pause the game while sleeping._
- _Fixed bug where FPS cap wouldn't work nor save._
- _Fixed bug where carrots wouldn't harvest successfully._
- _Fixed bug where you could move your highlighted hotbar while being paused._
- _Fixed bug that caused dirt to not perform the despawn animation correctly._
- _Fixed major performance issues._

**Now for the fun part:**

#### 'We added a Bowling minigame!'

I'm gonna be honest here. Backend is REALLY happy about this... we at Frontend tho...

Look, it wasn't on the original plan, it was a happy accident that the lead programmer decided to implement in the game.

  

No, we are not gonna show anything, I'm just salty about it.

#### 'Replaced the old energy bar GUI.'

Not long ago, a new artist joined the team, and his first job was to revamp some old assets that were... ugly. Now this looks stunnign! Hopefully the game's quality will improve this way.

#### 'Remade Shader.'

#### 

  

Pretty self-explanatory, don't you think?

  

'Buying is now functional!'

As shown in the [last devlog's](https://farteamdev.blogspot.com/2022/09/concept-art-and-future-of-game.html) concept art, the buying system has been added and it is fully... ugly. The GUI will be added in the future, thing is that we first need to finish the seller's design to add all the assets at once. Just trust me it won't be this ugly.

#### 'Selling is now functional!'

Same as above, all assets are placeholders and will be changed in the future. But the feature works properly.

### Then, why is it called 'The Hoe Update'?

~cause of your mom.~

In most resource management farming games, there are a set of tools that the player has to carry everywhere, which takes important inventory space. Even tho I know that this is part of managing your inventory as one of your resources, I still find is as a design flaw.

Since our character has the power of telekinesis, I thought it was a good idea to change the concept of tools for abilities. How would this work? Well, the player will find these tools all around the world and they will be added to a secondary hotbar as a selectable ability related to the tool... as of now none of what I said is on the game, but we needed to test the hoe as a first ability so we downloaded a Minecraft hoe model and called it a day.

  

In the video you'll be able to see these bullet-points:

  

-Now you can only plow land while holding a hoe, instead of doing it with your bare hands at any time. -Added a "Ghost" preview where you are going to plant/plow.

-Remade the planting and plowing systems.

  

### You said there were more good news!

Yes, I did. A couple of months ago I said there was an animator in the team. Well...

  

  

And that's all for now. Next month will be about replacing placeholder assets and adding the last type of crop the game needs.

  

Bye! Have a great time!
