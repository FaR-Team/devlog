Since the team was founded back in 2022, F.a.R. Team has embraced the belief that games are for everyone, and that not only means that accessibility should be our main pillar during development (Which it is), but it also means that representation and diversity are very important things to both create interesting and engaging stories and to help people feel seen, valued and celebrated.

From the stories we tell to our characters, we strive to reflect the reality we live in, which, incidentally, creates very interesting scenarios anyone would enjoy. Just imagine a game were everybody were identical; same race, same sexual orientation, same capabilities. That would be very boring! No shade to EA Sports FC-

While creating Project Codename: Farmoxel, this philosophy got us to create a roster of interesting characters. Though some of them were already showcased in previous blog posts, we feel the need to talk about them even further to celebrate them again and share more about why they mean so much to us.

### Theodore and his unique focus on orientation.

His art hasn't been updated yet :(

  

Back in the [**Character Design post**](https://blog.farteam.digital/2023/09/character-design-on-farmoxel-project.html) we referred to him as "The Pianist", now, he officially has a name; Theodore.

  

Theodore grew up as an only child in a very liberal family. Many stories might choose to focus solely on his orientation and the challenges of "coming out of the closet" to friends and family. While this may be a valid approach, we believe LGBTQ+ people have countless other stories to tell beyond this.

  

We get to learn about Theodore's orientation not long after we met him, his journey is not centered around that. Instead, his development focuses on his family dynamics and his relationship with the world around him. He is shy, quiet and reserved boy, but in contrast, his family wants to show him to the world both for his unique talent but also cause he is… different.

  

Although his parents love him deeply, they struggle to understand his boundaries, often unintentionally crossing lines in their efforts to celebrate him. Through Theodore’s story, we want to explore this nuanced and often overlooked aspect of life; the tension between love and misunderstanding, and the complexities of being seen versus being truly understood.

  

### Carolina's passion in overcoming.

New designs and art style leak? Woops~

  

Carolina isn't a Bibury native, she’s just passing through, chasing her passion for photography. Her love for capturing the world through a lens is the central **focus** _(Hehe, get it?)_ of her character.  
  
When she was young, she suffered an accident that damaged her left eye, leaving her partially blind. This never define or discouraged her, on the contrary. She turned it into a source of motivation. She wanted to overcome this disability to show the world there was nothing that could stop her. 

  

In high school, she attended an art class that changed everything. Learning how cameras work fascinated her. These incredible machines, despite the challenge of having only one eye, could create stunning works of art. For Carolina, this discovery wasn’t just practical, it was deeply personal. She’d found her calling, something she felt truly connected to.

  

Since then, Carolina has traveled the world, capturing the beauty of nature and turning it into art. Her journey eventually brought her to Bibury, where her life took an unexpected turn…

### Ragout in a multicolor world.

Have you seen them without their apron yet?

  

The cast has a lot of racial diversity; Black, Asian, mixed-race, ginger, Latino characters, and more. This kind of representation might seem like the most obvious step when thinking about diversity, and while it’s important, there’s another group we felt deserved more attention: people with vitiligo.

  

Vitiligo isn’t a race, but it’s still a highly underrepresented group in media. Despite affecting around 2% of the global population, you don’t often see characters with this condition. My philosophy is simple: if something exists, it can (and should) be represented in stories.

  

Not long ago I've seen a fictional character with vitiligo and the characterization was... mediocre. Her entire characterization boiled down to “being strong” because of bullying, even though the story itself never explored the condition meaningfully. That’s not the kind of representation I want to create.

I don't want Ragout to be defined by their vitiligo. They are a seasoned businessman and one of the oldest villagers in Bibury. These attributes will drive much of their development, leading to complex and engaging situations. While their condition is part of who they are, it’s not their _only_ story. At the same time, they provide an opportunity to raise awareness about vitiligo in a way that feels natural and meaningful.

For us, it’s about finding that balance: celebrating uniqueness without turning it into a gimmick. Ragout is someone we hope players will see as layered, relatable, and authentic.

Nuance is key. People are complex, and their stories deserve to be told authentically—not as tokens or to fill checkboxes. For us, the best way to celebrate diversity is by portraying diverse individuals as people first, with all their depth and humanity.

With that in mind, we want to be clear: we stand firmly by these values and will always advocate for inclusivity. We will not align ourselves with anyone who dismisses diversity as “woke” or fails to see its importance in creating richer, more meaningful stories.

Let this serve as an open letter of intent to anyone who wants to know who we are and what we stand for. At F.a.R. Team, diversity isn’t just a belief—it’s the heart of everything we do.
