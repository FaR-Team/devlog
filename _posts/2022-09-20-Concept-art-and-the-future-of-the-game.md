 After a whole month of complications, we are back on making progress on the game's development. Currently we are working on a buy/sell system (more on that below), character development, music design, and a ton of bug fixing. Sadly, most of this won't be finished by the end of the month. To avoid a disappointing post, we decided to share with you a bit of the current concept art and talk about the future of the game.

**With that said, let's go!**

### Protagonist's house blueprints

The protagonist's house is supposed to be a useful place where the player could feel safe and comfy, that's why the design is focused on coziness and utility. 

  

The first floor has three main things; first, it is the place where the protagonist's grandma will be when she is not working in her bakery. Second, in the kitchen you'll be able to use the various recipes you'll get _somewhere else_ to prepare different dishes. Last, it is the place where you'll be able to manage your storage.

  

Walking to the stairs will directly take you to the protagonist's bedroom (Yup, I'm sorry to tell you that you won't be able to explore the 2nd floor. Sad face). In the bedroom you'll have a trophy display, where you'll see all of your achievements. And obviously, your bed, which will let you skip the day and save the game.

  

Most of this is not set on stone, maybe in the future you'll be able to do more things inside the house, or less, but for now this is the plan.

  

### Sell system

In other farming games, the player is able to sell stuff by walking to a store and giving your stuff to the cleric in exchange of money, this doesn't seem realistic... In our game, your farm is partnering with a greengrocery. Daily, a truck will come to the farm and will take whatever you've got ready to sell. The only thing you have to do is to leave everything you want to sell in a big box near your farm and wait till the next day.

If you are selling more than five different items, a huge box will appear instead!

### Shop GUI design

Let me introduce you to one of the first characters of the game; his name is Ragú Ganen.

  

Ragú is a very successful entrepreneur. He owns most of the stores in the town and, somehow, always has what everybody needs. As of now, he is confirmed to own the gardening store:

As you can see, the interface is very simple, we divided it in colors to make it easier to explain:

* Money: This one is easy to comprehend... it is your money
* Inventory: If you forgot what you wanted to buy, you can always check your inventory to see what you are missing.
* Info: Here you can see a brief explanation of what you are buying and a couple of tips about it.
* Stock: Items, names and prices are displayed here. You see the numbers down there? Those are multipliers for if you have to make a HUGE purchase. You can either click one of them or press &lt;Shift&gt; for x5 and &lt;Ctrl&gt; for x10
* Basket: Everything you buy will go in there, if you click it, you'll see a list of everything you are buying, if it is correct, you just click the check and that's it!
* Ragú: He is welcoming you UwU

And that's everything we have to share with you. We really hope you like these ideas and we cannot wait for people to enjoy them once they are ready!

  

Bye! Have a great time!
