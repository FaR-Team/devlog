**¬†HAPPY NEW YEAR!** (Still January, not late yet.)  
  
With that out of the way... As you may remember, back in [**THIS POST**](https://farteamdev.blogspot.com/2023/09/character-design-on-farmoxel-project.html#more)¬†we talked about all the character that were designed at that point for the game. We presented you the humble amount of 7 characters. In today's post, we'll talk about the rest of the cast, which sums up the whacking amount of _19 CHARACTERS!_

_Before we begin, check this awesome piece made by Pipi of the Little Ballet Girl:_

So buckle up, 'cause this is gonna be a LONG ride...  

### The Protagonist!

Let's begin with the most important character of the game: You!  
  
This is the old concept created back in 2022:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjYa3CjbZGW07eOu7q7SAMLwcs1LZJzDqbBuBsi0YbRS9Qsy1vqUb_UyPlvZiV3fkOSg7DFu7WzHnzZJxnm-SrZviVya8SVQ1J87oh5gHyYyBFRUoNupFugd_cVm0bUa7Nr7kWxU0BXf8GsbBpoQpXeRE2Wa1H0U792obakeAk76zGJtQZwwLokSn1tXqn0=w300-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjYa3CjbZGW07eOu7q7SAMLwcs1LZJzDqbBuBsi0YbRS9Qsy1vqUb_UyPlvZiV3fkOSg7DFu7WzHnzZJxnm-SrZviVya8SVQ1J87oh5gHyYyBFRUoNupFugd_cVm0bUa7Nr7kWxU0BXf8GsbBpoQpXeRE2Wa1H0U792obakeAk76zGJtQZwwLokSn1tXqn0)

  

And now, Pipi's redesign:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhJrHi9zjfYUwP8HQguSojL73gOphsfX6uGQpKNXF7JypILb1ig0ajQ8ipvFbEra3jmT8cmGg3b2uTDTcXF4PK--TNj-duRnQy2ptJV2rG_hKs5FOzj--8_TxKzhzYVoPEnI9eQ-a3A7dKEQOl52IdIVMriZ39_7PHx3xe5i6hW98e2G1NEcYJkdhwhxKln=w238-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhJrHi9zjfYUwP8HQguSojL73gOphsfX6uGQpKNXF7JypILb1ig0ajQ8ipvFbEra3jmT8cmGg3b2uTDTcXF4PK--TNj-duRnQy2ptJV2rG_hKs5FOzj--8_TxKzhzYVoPEnI9eQ-a3A7dKEQOl52IdIVMriZ39_7PHx3xe5i6hW98e2G1NEcYJkdhwhxKln)

  

He has such a cute smile~

  

His name is Marko, his last name is... yet to be revealed. He is 14 years old. He is the current owner of the telekinetic powers, he is _unlinked._¬†Now, he has to learn to use his powers properly to help his grandmother with the farm. Obviously, he keeps these powers a secret, who knows how everyone would react to such supernatural phenomenon. We can say for sure that, besides that, he isn't hiding anything else. After all, you cannot hide things from yourself.

### Marko's Parents

Family meeting! Let's go!

  

These characters were planned not long ago, so there is no 2022 concept art. Instead, here are Pipi's designs:

I wanna hug them, not gonna lie.

  

The parent will be out of town for most of the game, leaving Marko under Sylvia's care. They are very hardworking, something that defined Marko's personality almost entirely. Not much is known about them in town, some neighbors don't even know their names...

### City Girl

I... really don't have any fun facts about this character so... like her boots? I chose them.

  

Back in 2022 she looked like this:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjm--LfoJ-hNBALilUXWyHMRxtSvrf4JDH55IgAQqhHId_0Gvubwgv77oRuHXyxhcrKlwBTKE2ii67M995BCeFL6jgU8DaWA8VWiXntn4mbZ9RnX5zF1Cr3yAb1KOVurLGeRRSB-fA-vlAvZy7TgpXakArVbPzkxzP6cnPpRtITCC3RC4ivIn1IkEiVLEv6=w278-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjm--LfoJ-hNBALilUXWyHMRxtSvrf4JDH55IgAQqhHId_0Gvubwgv77oRuHXyxhcrKlwBTKE2ii67M995BCeFL6jgU8DaWA8VWiXntn4mbZ9RnX5zF1Cr3yAb1KOVurLGeRRSB-fA-vlAvZy7TgpXakArVbPzkxzP6cnPpRtITCC3RC4ivIn1IkEiVLEv6)

  

And then Pipi did this:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjqC0JJ0KtHtNI-RrUx6qFSWaDabPMQ_vl1UzJRyArJVCRit5KtJooH6-0nouy6gN5tY8lwy75JvmyoFV7h3vH9Pbygrxz7YuUkl79AlLAvlB0tgIbboFByTMNi4tcQ_bLfIVEVEBoFJ6p7thmMlWbZwVpqqq9QHZNszQWp7KFoj7rkwr9XwSoH98eDmkFT=w130-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjqC0JJ0KtHtNI-RrUx6qFSWaDabPMQ_vl1UzJRyArJVCRit5KtJooH6-0nouy6gN5tY8lwy75JvmyoFV7h3vH9Pbygrxz7YuUkl79AlLAvlB0tgIbboFByTMNi4tcQ_bLfIVEVEBoFJ6p7thmMlWbZwVpqqq9QHZNszQWp7KFoj7rkwr9XwSoH98eDmkFT)

  
Seems like she didn't change much. After all, her old design wasn't bad at all... Slay üíÖüèª

  

She is new in town, but she is not staying for much. She dislikes the quietness and slow pace of a tiny isolated community. She rather the noise and the rhythm of the big city she comes from. Don't get it wrong, she is not a bad person, she is just... damaged. Of course, there is a pretty valid reason why she is in this town, but who knows? She always avoids that question...

### Ragout's employee

This character literally was created when I pasted the carrot's model to a random Unity Asset Store model and called it a disguise.

  
This is his old design back in 2022:

And then Pipi did these:

Why is he dressed as a carrot? Well, that's a very valid question ~nerd~. Ragout has some... weird methods when it comes to advertising, in fact, he expects all of his workers to do it... though he only has one. But the thing is that Ragout never asked this kid to use a disguise, he brought it himself from home, and he brings a different one each season. He seems to be a bit obsessed with work, and that may be related to his family.  

### Employee's parents

I need to start giving them actual names cause these titles will end up in a disaster... anyway.

  

There was no previous concept art of these characters, so let's jump straight to Pipi's design:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh0R-JQHHX8G6p91PP1HaV6LUx28lTkUDoiwleoAv1Pn4dFjSnhqYXzHFC7H2fO3W-77jlQxEdICDn4UZ_PGPsqAJ-Sv57Q-DyKTjQUGoDA4kJCRRJsR276ct5sGLUN_UVNPZsUENrJbJxhC9zPx6n7UAk8ySo7KveueSkQo01prnYFng5N4uIwW4Sw7Bcd=w640-h533)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh0R-JQHHX8G6p91PP1HaV6LUx28lTkUDoiwleoAv1Pn4dFjSnhqYXzHFC7H2fO3W-77jlQxEdICDn4UZ_PGPsqAJ-Sv57Q-DyKTjQUGoDA4kJCRRJsR276ct5sGLUN_UVNPZsUENrJbJxhC9zPx6n7UAk8ySo7KveueSkQo01prnYFng5N4uIwW4Sw7Bcd)

  

These two are not... entirely sane. Age did its thing on them and now they are a responsibility for Ragout's employee. He works that much to keep them safe and give them everything they need, just as they did when he was young. On the bright side, they have a great relationship with each other. Any time one of them is ready to do one of their antics, the other one will be more than willing to join them. Hopefully, Ragout's employee is ready to confront every single situation they'll put themselves in.

### Twins

Originally these kids were going to have their own household, but that changed mid development.

  

These were their concept art back on 2022:  

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh1euU7lj4sthKHWMEYgneJjzDshhSHDaMqErznAcBCprpouZC9VFJLXqG-60f62lUTXTlYn6OHAkm2pDaP9murytjbiPeZkJB_ufagNYWFFxi3OuXi-ZI_sXAYYX2u0bAZdr0CNcjGRrQ_zKDRwj-2IDm_LMZKfkx5uzOcNosGC8Em2pp3g88HquCaoHMm=w300-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEh1euU7lj4sthKHWMEYgneJjzDshhSHDaMqErznAcBCprpouZC9VFJLXqG-60f62lUTXTlYn6OHAkm2pDaP9murytjbiPeZkJB_ufagNYWFFxi3OuXi-ZI_sXAYYX2u0bAZdr0CNcjGRrQ_zKDRwj-2IDm_LMZKfkx5uzOcNosGC8Em2pp3g88HquCaoHMm)![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEj2TcOZZgZ0U6wC1e954Nsxm_j6HoJQ2Er17x7Oc3DqjbMkDX4JXq8K7l6P8bjigTKt8rYHzi2EQhxAMuPOvkCD2ltlm7771T5aenAop6EpRhKzvTRkriWZcsUzQfLb4bZUVjhtLh85j6NpscuAdvpt2N3zgjCwQ_fQjui-LRYy0GNwsvKsIQNLoGC5CQhU=w300-h400)

And this is what Pipi did:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi2wvt2Aq8xfHDW8uCKxFyn_a9Aym365m-7ojElf0xTPBcFJYJgVKCzo-qvnthHKZg9X_4blBLF5k95-3TUN4QDitEFtc3jw9yGaGGj13_L-fwcKwZ5pQKsInri76XL77JC4ILD0WforpC2pvaok2KX-41-9QwW-Vv3qLJ0_XYWeFVcQ6jdZLgJkzxdPC-p=w280-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi2wvt2Aq8xfHDW8uCKxFyn_a9Aym365m-7ojElf0xTPBcFJYJgVKCzo-qvnthHKZg9X_4blBLF5k95-3TUN4QDitEFtc3jw9yGaGGj13_L-fwcKwZ5pQKsInri76XL77JC4ILD0WforpC2pvaok2KX-41-9QwW-Vv3qLJ0_XYWeFVcQ6jdZLgJkzxdPC-p)

  
From now on let's call them Twin A (Left) and twin B (Right).

  

Twin A is a very mischievous kid. He will be Marko's (Your) best friend. As of now, he knows nothing about Marko's powers, he just wants to have adventures with his best friends since he gets bored really fast.

Twin B, in the other hand, is a pretty shy boy. He is not very outgoing, in fact, if there is a possibility he can avoid social contact, he'll use it.

They are the Ukelele Player's young siblings.

Thing is... where is Twin B?

### Ukelele Girl's parents

Time to show a big family.

  

Once again, there were no designs back in 2022, so let's jump straight to Pipi's designs:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgz6zprSv-ITr1S462adHL1xFsAP7sm_7gXOVj9-1XGoPoK397alI6-9vPuESqOwDacHvWpGS9tB0OPx6wpOIKTnHJHteNEf2L0Nf-NwPAjLAt0UANLMctG7riDx7l4wf5vMSUaqi7HTFo9dVBgL52UDw7lvqrQWwamQFfQnB7i9zCMqlSvsBTu_3yZwz9W=w400-h333)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgz6zprSv-ITr1S462adHL1xFsAP7sm_7gXOVj9-1XGoPoK397alI6-9vPuESqOwDacHvWpGS9tB0OPx6wpOIKTnHJHteNEf2L0Nf-NwPAjLAt0UANLMctG7riDx7l4wf5vMSUaqi7HTFo9dVBgL52UDw7lvqrQWwamQFfQnB7i9zCMqlSvsBTu_3yZwz9W)

  

What a cute lil family, anyway.

  

The father is a construction worker. He, among other people of his team, is responsible of all the buildings on the town. He knows every single inch of the place; he even knows what the town is hiding...¬†  
The mother is an old friend of Sylvia. Unlike Ragout and Sylvia, she arrived to the town a couple years ago. As soon as they moved, she applied to work on Sylvia's bakery.  
They are both very workaholics, in fact, they rather stay at work than doing anything else. And when they are not working, they are doing something at home to keep them busy. It's like... they are trying to avoid something.  

### Amanda Leiram

A full name! Not even the protagonist has a full name yet!

  

Again, no 2022 design. Pipi's design:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg0maeJd_vm-DOEWI_UDkwezgSASBOP8lBhxtP_lomLidgjWpidL5lBFa0FtB2IZmfmhEvjJF7sezpNjzU3CYJ7ytw0uJd3fb5ysjtGrTeOKPX2LWhP0it8UuGwNPPpIG-t-UaT9PaP-rf4TEX1JFnCencfiZVVXDX3fQTA5jP9i6BcTaHdrWLp7IWRNP65=w132-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEg0maeJd_vm-DOEWI_UDkwezgSASBOP8lBhxtP_lomLidgjWpidL5lBFa0FtB2IZmfmhEvjJF7sezpNjzU3CYJ7ytw0uJd3fb5ysjtGrTeOKPX2LWhP0it8UuGwNPPpIG-t-UaT9PaP-rf4TEX1JFnCencfiZVVXDX3fQTA5jP9i6BcTaHdrWLp7IWRNP65)

  
She looks so serious, look, she has a lab coat.

  

Amanda is relatively new to the town. She arrived a week before the game takes place. A month before she arrived, an improvised laboratory was built in an old building that used to be an old video club. Nobody needs video clubs anymore. Now she works at that laboratory almost every day, and when she is not there, she is nowhere to be found. Who is she? What does she want in the town? Why build a whole lab? TOO MANY QUESTIONS!!!

### Nerd

Oh my god, how do I even tackle this one...?

  

Old design't. Pipi did:

  

[![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjIXPbXu1Ts03BplGEacLCTNkc44kyLv3b6DLVaNft3GTO8OnylK1-SYMYbUb4a-q5tenx2UAfXv5tyiQU-hyvIC6vKko2UEK2HL-zg8mJ23GAKO0DEWAtCke9vszHwg_IwRzAkMUcfqPlLUvbuJCrvZwnRFJTlybGPIhNZ1L5eppQtJK1Lunte_kyyO4wR=w190-h400)](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjIXPbXu1Ts03BplGEacLCTNkc44kyLv3b6DLVaNft3GTO8OnylK1-SYMYbUb4a-q5tenx2UAfXv5tyiQU-hyvIC6vKko2UEK2HL-zg8mJ23GAKO0DEWAtCke9vszHwg_IwRzAkMUcfqPlLUvbuJCrvZwnRFJTlybGPIhNZ1L5eppQtJK1Lunte_kyyO4wR)

  
I'm not gonna see the end of the consequences of this design...

  

This... individual... is obsessed with two things: Radios and whales. Why? Because. He spends most of his time in his mother's attic recording a podcast about whales. But he is not obsessed with entertainment radios, he is obsessed with communication radios. In fact, his biggest dream is to build a long reach ham radio in his attic so he can speak with other radio enthusiasts, and it's Marko's jobs to help him pursue his dream. After all, what could go wrong?

### Nerd's Mother

The naming thing is gonna be a nightmare...

  

N.D.;P.D.:

What a nice-looking lady, I'm sure she is as nice as she seems.

  

She wants her son out of her house ASAP. She is tired of seeing him wasting his time instead of looking for a job, a house or at least a girlfriend. She is too old to have to deal with this. At this age, she should be enjoying the fruits of her effort. But instead, she has a 30 years old parasite in her attic. What wouldn't she do to get rid of her son...?

### Little ballet girl's father

Daddy, I mean, daddy, I mean, daddy, I mean, daddy, I mean-

  

You know what goes here:

Daddy, I mean... he works on a company far from town, and, since he doesn't have his own car, he relies on public transportation to go from home to work and back, thus you will only see him at night. His work environment ain't the healthiest of all, which dragged his sanity slowly. Added to that, he started drinking when his wife died. He has... issues.¬†

### The Flutist's parents

Let's talk about business...

Dadd-

\*Ehem\* Sorry.¬†

  

The Flutist's Mother is the owner of the company where the Little Ballet Girl's father works (‚ú®NAMES‚ú®). She is... perfect. And she wants everything and everyone to be perfect. She lives constantly disappointed by everyone 'cause no one meets her expectations. There is always someone not smart enough, not good-looking enough or not rich enough. Her employees do not enjoy much working for her, but sadly, they have no other choice...

The father is a m-m-m-model... a hands model, that is.

### The Pianist's parents

WE ARE ALMOST DONE!

These are some interesting characters...

  

The father is very laid-back about... well, everything. He is a spiritual card reader. Wether or not his beliefs are truth is yet to be proven. But he enjoys what he does. He enjoys it so much that he does it for free, which turns it into a waste of his time and talent.¬†

The mother is a botanist. She has her own business on town, tho it is not very successful... I'm not entirely sure on how these guys make a living...

They both want their son to be happy, whatever that would mean for him.

  

  

And that would be it! I really hope that you like the cast as much as we do. We put a lot of thought and effort to make each one of them as interesting as possible. Of course, they are all tied to changes, so maybe this is not how they are going to look like/act once the game is done, but certainly it is nice to have an archive of the whole development.  
In the future we may add more characters that were discarded in the beginning, but that will depend on a lot of factors.

  

I know this is not the kind of devlog you'd expect, but the rest of the team is still working on the huge save/load system. Plus, they had a lot of personal things to attend that prevented them to work on it. If the wind is in our side, next week or so you'll have a new devlog talking about what are our expectations for 2024!  
  

Thak you very much for reading.

  

**Bye! Have a great time!**
